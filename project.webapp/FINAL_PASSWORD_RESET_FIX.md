# 🔐 FINAL PASSWORD RESET FIX

## 🚨 **Your Current Issue**
You're getting "Invalid or expired reset token" because you're using an **OLD, EXPIRED TOKEN** from a previous password reset request.

1. **Backend server is now running properly** ✅
2. **Token expiration calculation is fixed** ✅
3. **Enhanced logging is added** ✅
4. **Port conflict resolved** ✅

## 🎯 **SOLUTION: You Need a NEW Token**

### **The Fix:**
You need to request a **NEW** password reset to get a **NEW** token.

1. Go to your login page
2. Click "Forgot your password?"
3. Enter your email address
4. Click "Send Reset Link"
5. **Wait for the NEW email**

### **Step 2: Use the NEW Reset Link**
1. **Check your email** (including spam folder)
2. **Find the NEWEST email** (most recent one)
3. **Click the NEW reset link**

## 🔧 **Why This Happens**

### **Token Lifecycle:**

2. **Use token** → Password updated, token marked as used
3. **Try to use again** → "Invalid or expired token" error

### **Common Scenarios:**
- **Expired**: Waited too long to use the link
- **Already used**: Clicked the link multiple times
- **Old link**: Using a link from a previous request
